    <em>"Now I can't even read the news today, it remind me of yesterday..."</em>
            The Swedish artist Sanna Nilsen sang this words in her song "Empty Room", and I agree with her.
            Have you ever read the news and felt "Woho! All is awsome in the world!" I mean, the news are sad, boring and often unintresting.
            FAKE NEWS! The one site where you can read about fake news without needing to worry about if it's fact check, we already done that part,
            and we are pretty sure it's all bogus. That said, enjoy a more intresting read!

<h2>What do I get to work with?</h2>

In this repository you get a bunch of fun/scary files to look at (depending on coding experience).
<ul>
    <li>
        A <strong>settings</strong> folder with files for the modern life hacker
            <ul>
                <li>a <strong>LICENSE-file</strong>. - Makes sence to read (get it? SENCE?)</li>
                <li><strong>settings.json</strong> - You know, so you know, how I know, that you see, what I see.</li>
            </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        A <strong>updates</strong> folder (bonus files that wasn't part of assignment (SPOILERS!))
        <ul>
            <li><strong>sign-out.php</strong> - the page that handles signing out (daaaaa...)</li>
            <li><strong>upload.php</strong> - the page that handles the news upload (probly should have kept this as a funciton...)</li>
            <li><strong>user-check.php</strong> - HERE'S where a lot of stuff happening surounding the user (like a hub page to call functions from)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

    <li><strong>footer.php</strong> - No, it's the bottom of the html tree, not a resturant (sorry guys...)</li>
    <li><strong>functions.php</strong> - List all the juicy functions of the site. (All out of apples though...)</li>
    <li><strong>header.php</strong> - Use your head! At least that's what the HTML is using this file for.</li>
    <li><strong>index.php</strong> - The main page that ties the net together (At least our site, maybe not the whole internet)</li>
    <li><strong>join.php</strong> - Here you find the sign up/sign in form, cause how else would we save know who wrote what?</li>
