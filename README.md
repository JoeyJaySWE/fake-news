    <em>"Now I can't even read the news today, it remind me of yesterday..."</em>
            The Swedish artist Sanna Nilsen sang this words in her song "Empty Room", and I agree with her.
            Have you ever read the news and felt "Woho! All is awsome in the world!" I mean, the news are sad, boring and often unintresting.
            FAKE NEWS! The one site where you can read about fake news without needing to worry about if it's fact check, we already done that part,
            and we are pretty sure it's all bogus. That said, enjoy a more intresting read!

<h2>What do I get to work with?</h2>

In this repository you get a bunch of fun/scary files to look at (depending on coding experience).
<ul>
    <li> 
        A <strong>Assets</strong> folder that contains some cool stuff like
        <ul>
            <li>A <strong>icons</strong> folder that contains allt he images used in the site</li>
            <li><strong>articles.css</strong> - The design for all our articles (EXTRA! EXTRA! DEVELOPER LIES ABOUT "DESIGN")</li>
            <li><strong>defaults.css</strong> - Sets the default behaviour for elements that doesn't contain class specific codes</li>
            <li><strong>users.css</strong> - Here is all our designs for the user GUI (That's "GUI", Not "GEY")</li>
    </li>
    <li>
        A <strong>settings</strong> folder with files for the modern life hacker
            <ul>
                <li>a <strong>LICENSE-file</strong>. - Makes sence to read (get it? SENCE?)</li>

            <li><strong>upload.php</strong> - the page that handles the news upload (probly should have kept this as a funciton...)</li>
            <li><strong>user-check.php</strong> - HERE'S where a lot of stuff happening surounding the user (like a hub page to call functions from)</li>

</ul>


<h2>Install instructions</h2>
<p>
    Clone the file down and that's it really. <br>
    Buuuuut if you really wanna have more fun, try grabing the skin of a long dead cat,
    climb the highest mmountain growing in the shade of a radio tower, 
    gargle the some swamp water while citing from the holy bible in reverse,
    THEN try the stuff on the first row (it's really all you need to do).
</p>

<h2>Known bugs</h2>

He he he..., WHERE TO BEGIN?!
<br>
Actually it ain't that bad. So far there is only one bug that seams to be happening about 50% of the time.
If you press a like or disslike button, you may need to sign back in to the site. 
Nothing wrong with the code as far as I can see though, anyone spots the issue or a sulotion, plese fork and send me a merge request!
