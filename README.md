First code assignment from WU20 at YRGO

    <em>"Now I can't even read the news today, it remind me of yesterday..."</em>
            The Swedish artist Sanna Nilsen sang this words in her song "Empty Room", and I agree with her.
            Have you ever read the news and felt "Woho! All is awsome in the world!" I mean, the news are sad, boring and often unintresting.
            FAKE NEWS! The one site where you can read about fake news without needing to worry about if it's fact check, we already done that part,
            and we are pretty sure it's all bogus. That said, enjoy a more intresting read!

</p>

<h2>What do I get to work with?</h2>

In this repository you get a bunch of fun/scary files to look at (depending on coding experience).
<ul>
    <li> 
        A <strong>Assets</strong> folder that contains some cool stuff like
        <ul>
            <li>A <strong>icons</strong> folder that contains allt he images used in the site</li>
            <li><strong>articles.css</strong> - The design for all our articles (EXTRA! EXTRA! DEVELOPER LIES ABOUT "DESIGN")</li>
            <li><strong>defaults.css</strong> - Sets the default behaviour for elements that doesn't contain class specific codes</li>
    </li>
    <li>
        A <strong>updates</strong> folder (bonus files that wasn't part of assignment (SPOILERS!))
        <ul>
            <li><strong>vote-check.php</strong> - Here's where we check if you have liked or disliked a article</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>a <strong>LICENSE-file</strong>. - Makes sence to read (get it? SENCE?)</li>
    <li><strong>.editorconfig</strong> - You know, so you know, how I know, that you see, what I see.</li>
    <li><strong>articles.php</strong> - Fetches and lists all our articles fromt he database</li>
    <li><strong>data.php</strong> - for.... data (sorry but some of these shoudl be self explenatory)</li>
    <li><strong>fake-news-db.sqlite3</strong> - Tis is the wholy grail, the database. Here we fetch all our hard work (and spend most of our time cursing it's very being).</li>
    <li><strong>footer.php</strong> - No, it's the bottom of the html tree, not a resturant (sorry guys...)</li>
    <li><strong>functions.php</strong> - List all the juicy functions of the site. (All out of apples though...)</li>
    <li><strong>header.php</strong> - Use your head! At least that's what the HTML is using this file for.</li>
    <li><strong>index.php</strong> - The main page that ties the net together (At least our site, maybe not the whole internet)</li>
    <li><strong>README.md</strong> - READ ME! Wait... you currently are... nevermind!</li>
    <li><strong>.gitignore</strong> - Feel free to ignore these..</li>
</ul>


<h2>Install instructions</h2>
<p>
    Clone the file down and that's it really. <br>
    Buuuuut if you really wanna have more fun, try grabing the skin of a long dead cat,
    climb the highest mmountain growing in the shade of a radio tower, 
    gargle the some swamp water while citing from the holy bible in reverse,
    THEN try the stuff on the first row (it's really all you need to do).
</p>
